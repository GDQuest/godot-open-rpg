# Game Concept

A turn-based role-playing game engine inspired by the earliest titles in the Final Fantasy series.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide the gamedev community with a demo that shows how game systems work together in a complete 2D Godot game demo.

The demo draws inspiration from RPG Maker and older JRPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest as well as the Godot 3 OpenRPG.

Throughout the project, heavy emphasis is to be placed on code that is...
- ...updated to take advantage of what GDScript 4 has to offer.
- ...simple, to best serve as a starting point for those diving into the project.
- ...made to conform to GDQuest's [GDScript guidelines](https://gdquest.gitbook.io/gdquests-guidelines/godot-gdscript-guidelines).

## Project Scope

We're creating a vertical slice of gameplay, with a duration of roughly 10-20 minutes.

## Story

WIP

## Mechanics

The game's mechanics draw from classical JRPGs.

The idea is to produce a standard yet a flexible foundation, primarily inspired by old Final Fantasy games and RPG maker, to allow for greater creative freedom with the game's content.

### Combat system

Battle encounters are turn-based. The battlers act one after the other in an order decided depending on their speed.

Each character has a distinct set of available combat actions and a slightly different gameplay or strategic options.

## Characters

WIP

## Aesthetics

Cute, colorful, round, stylized.

## The world

The game's world is an allegory of the "game creatorâ€™s journey" and the chief villain - ***distraction***!

### Monsters: the Bugs

The monsters in the game spawn from software bugs.

The protagonists encounter bugs on their way to their goal. Bugs arise from anywhere, from any game component, including e.g. the UI, and sometimes from the characters themselves.
